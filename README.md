### Awesome dotfiles for Lucas

Yes these are my config files, that I love to improve from time to time. And will be handy on fast starting on a new setup/computer.

To install just run on install.

```
./install
```

About the bashrc config inside this repo, just remember to make source then on the main bashrc file. You probably will use Oh My Bash to improve the visuals.
